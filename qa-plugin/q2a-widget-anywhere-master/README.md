Widget Anywhere (Question2Answer plugin)
=================================================

A plugin for [Question2Answer](http://www.question2answer.org) that allows the placement of any content snippet on any page, in a variety of locations.

Suggestions/bugs can be reported to me here on Github or at [this post onstudentrf](http://www.question2answer.org/qa/15066/)


Installation & Usage
-------------------------------------------------

1. Download and extract the files to your plugins folder (e.g. `qa-plugins/widget-anywhere`).
2. In Q2A go to Admin > Plugins and click the database initialization link.
3. In the plugin options, click 'Add new widget' to create a module. Enter a title (this is not displayed on the front-end), the position, pages to appear on, ordering (relative to other WA modules) and the HTML content. Anything is allowed, including scripts.

To show a module across every page, tick the first box. Note that certain positions (e.g. 'After question text') are not available on all pages.

Widgets can also be added on custom pages: tick 'Show on custom page(s)' and enter the page slugs (URL fragments) in the field.

To edit a module, click the appropriate link from the plugin options. Make the required changes and save. To delete a module, go to its edit page, tick the "Delete widget" checkbox and save.
