## Bug reports

Before you [post a bug](https://github.com/q2apro/q2apro-on-site-notifications/issues), please try the following steps that might resolve your issue: 

### Check list to solve the Problem

1. Have you checked the admin panel if the plugin is there and enabled? Go to `admin/plugins`. Have you clicked "Initialize database for this module" (in case it appeared).
2. Remove the history plugin, see if it works now.
3. Login with a different account, vote on your answer. Login with the other account, see if there is a vote. Alternatively: Ask a question, use a different account to answer it, see if you get a notification.
4. Check your server files (the root) for the `error_log` file. Report the content in your issue.
5. Open Firefox Developer Tools > Network. Check if there is a request sent to the server when you click on the "N" (notification bubble) next to the username.
6. Check your database if there are entries in the table `qa_eventlog`.
7. Check your database table `qa_options` if there is "event_logger_to_database" == 1.
8. Check your database table `qa_options` if you find the options "q2apro_onsitenotifications_enabled", "q2apro_onsitenotifications_nill", "q2apro_onsitenotifications_maxage", "q2apro_onsitenotifications_maxevshow" with values.
9. Check your HTML source if the two files "script.js" ans "styles.css" are correctly linked (search for `qa-plugin/q2apro-on-site-notifications/`).
10. Is there the table `qa_usermeta` in your database?
11. Check that the field `site_url` in your database table `qa_options` matches all your URLs.
12. Rewrite all your domains to one domain (e.g. q2apro.com â†’ www.q2apro.com). To do so, use .htaccess. Next is an example how to rewrite all *domains/xyz* to *www.q2apro.com/xyz* (of course, replace *q2apro.com* with your domain name that matches the field `site_url`):
 
	`RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} .`  
	`RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\.q2apro\.com [NC]`  
	`RewriteRule (.*) http://www.q2apro.com/$1 [R=301,L]`  

13. Do you use a custom theme? Maybe this is changing the layout and breaking the plugin. We cannot help you for free with that (see note below<sup>1</sup>).


If these steps did not solve your problem and if your issue has not been reported already, then post your detailed bug report.
